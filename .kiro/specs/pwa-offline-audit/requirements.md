# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a comprehensive PWA (Progressive Web App) offline functionality audit and improvement project for the Kırklareli 112 Emergency Medical Assistant application. The application is a production PWA serving emergency medical services with 80+ medical algorithms, 300+ quiz questions, voice commands, GPS location finder, translation system, videos, and other critical features. The goal is to ensure all features work completely offline, optimize cache strategies, and implement PWA best practices.
